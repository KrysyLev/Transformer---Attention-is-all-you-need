# Transformer - Attention Is All You Need

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer model from the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) using PyTorch. The Transformer is a deep learning architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and various other domains.

## Features
- Implements the Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch.
- Supports self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encodings.
- Includes an example training pipeline on a toy dataset.
- Modular and extensible code structure.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

## Usage
### Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.0005
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model.pth
```

## Model Overview
The Transformer consists of the following components:
- **Input Embedding**: Converts input tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about token positions in a sequence.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures dependencies across all tokens.
- **Feedforward Network**: Applies transformations to the attention outputs.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**: Helps stabilize training.
- **Output Projection**: Maps final embeddings to vocabulary probabilities.

## Results
Performance metrics and visualizations will be added after training.
